# Congress-Info-Search

Built a website which allows users to access and share the latest information of congress information by using CongressAPI and AngularJS to request PHP codes through the server that deployed on AWS/GAE.
Empowered the website with functions of data filtering (AngularJS), create/edit list (LocalStorage) and page navigation, client/server data exchange and web responsiveness (Bootstrap).
